# Sundial Project

## Environment

- Python virtual environment is at `.venv/`. Always use it.
- Use `uv` for all Python dependency operations (install, add, remove, sync).
- Spec documents (DATABASE.md, BACKEND.md, OVERVIEW.md, FRONTEND.md) are in `docs/`.
- Plans and implementation logs are in `plans/`.
- This project uses Tailwind + DaisyUI. Apply `/tailwind-ui-styling` for all UI work.
